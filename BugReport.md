7. Select **I‚Äôm applying by myself** as the number of borrowers.
8. Fill in the **Project Details**:

   - Property price: _300000_
   - Property will be used for: _Living_

### ‚úÖ Expected results:

- A mortgage simulation report should be displayed.
- The overview should include:
  - Total project cost 348,278
  - Total mortgage amount 248,478
  - Monthly payment estimate 1433
  - Available loan offers from Mensualiteit

### ‚ùå Actual results:

- The mortgage simulation report is **not displayed**.
- No offers are visible.

### üîé Extra details:

The problem seems to come from the fact that the `/default_products/` API request does not return any products in the response.

This is the response received on the "delta" environment where the issue can be reproduced:

`{"count":0,"next":null,"previous":null,"results":{"products":[]}}`

Also, this causes the subsequent `offers/?is_borrower_acceptance_rules=true&generate_url=true&language=en-UK` API request to contain an empty list of `selected_products` inside its payload.

Running the same test on the [base environment](https://demo-report-base-self-service.operengineering.com/app/simulation) leads to a completely different response from the same API request, which contains a list of 9 products avilable for this customer.
